This is a project for Learn Python the Hard Way, exercise 46.

A game called TENENBAUM, in which you must venture away from home at
night, to get a Christmas Tree last minute, so Santa has a place to
drop off presents at your house.

Written in Python3.6.0, intended to be played in the Terminal.

Current version: v0.4

This game is still a work in progress, see main.py docstring for
a current features list, and a to-do list of what remains in this build.
